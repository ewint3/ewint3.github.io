      <img src="assets/images/Porto-Rico.jpg" class="image" alt="Ewin Tucker">

      <p>Im from Rome, Ga and moved to the Nashville area a few months ago. I currently work for a welding and medical supply company. I'm taking this class here at Vanderbilt because coding has always interested me. All the work that goes into developing a web site and to see the final outcome is rewarding.</p>

      <p>My hobbies are kayaking and hiking. I like to play video games on the ps4 console. Also, I'm into reading and collecting comic books. Im more into the Marvel universe and my favorite heroes are Spider-Man and Wolverine. When I lived in Florida I would surf on my long baord.</p>

      <p>I am the oldest of four siblings and have four nephews and three nieces. I have 3 dogs. Their names are Milli, Merle, and Moose.  </p>
